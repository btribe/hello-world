As I can write whatever I want, I choose a fragment of a beautiful poem. 
Enjoy...

She walks in beauty, like the night 
Of cloudless climes and starry skies; 
And all thatâ€™s best of dark and bright 
Meet in her aspect and her eyes; 
Thus mellowed to that tender light 
Which heaven to gaudy day denies.

(Fragment of "She Walks in Beauty" by Lord Byron).
